## Linux Basics Wrap Ups and Next Steps

I also wanted to get some hands-on experience with Linux. Here is a list of completed tasks.

Completing first 5 levels in overthewire:

[Learning Cybersecurity with OverTheWire: Bandit 1 - 5 - Jamikal Hall](https://jamikal.xyz/posts/bandit1-5/) and the text only version on [github](https://github.com/JamikalHall/playground-v2/blob/main/content/posts/bandit1-5.md)

completed these 3 rooms on tryhackme:

https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1
https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2
https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart3

takeaway: Not a linux expert, far from it, but I know how to navigate around the system without needing a GUI interface. I can interact with files, update software, and move around directories.

I decided to move forward with my learning at this point since I think I have a basic understanding of Linux. I enjoy getting the hands on practice with Linux using CTFs like overthewire and tryhackme, so I will continue to gain hands-on experience through tasks like this instead of trying to memorize commands.

Next, I will work on programming: Bash and Golang.
