# DevSecOps

## The Point

The goal of this repository is track my learning of Development, Security, and Operations practices and technologies. I have switched from writing blog posts on my personal site to using Github because it became annoying to manage themes with Hugo, and if I'm just writing markdown files anyway, I can do this just fine through Github.

I bias technology selection based on personal preference and what has the most documentation available.

## Why DevSecOps

I love DevOps and Cybersecurity and I found it difficult to choose between the two. I enjoyed learning how to secure technology, as well as automating processes. The approach I would like to take is to learn both DevOps and Cybersecurity concepts and create projects to facilitate my learning.

This was inspired by [Michael Cade's 90 Days of DevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) and while I do not want to put an X amount of days to it, I do want to use a similar style of documenting each day. Each blog should list the resource or training that I completed, along with notes and any key takeaways I gathered.
